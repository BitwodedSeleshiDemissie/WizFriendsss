# WizFriends - A Social Discovery Platform 🌍👫

---

## 🚀 About the Startup

**WizFriends** is my **first startup** project aimed at creating a social discovery platform that connects people based on shared interests, activities, and local events. The app helps users:

- Discover nearby activities based on GPS.
- Create or join community groups and events.
- Connect with like-minded people who share similar passions.
- Participate in AI-generated activity ideas, endorsed by the community.

The goal of **WizFriends** is to foster connections, reduce loneliness, and help people build meaningful relationships when they move to new places or live away from home.

## 🎯 My Startup Journey: From Idea to SIT Torino Incubation

This is my **first startup**, and I'm incredibly excited to share that **WizFriends** has already been pitched to **Politecnico di Torino's startup incubation program (SIT Torino)**. I had the opportunity to present **WizFriends** to a panel of experts and mentors who support aspiring entrepreneurs in the university's innovation ecosystem.

### 🏆 Key Highlights:
- **Startup Stage**: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) – early-stage product development and testing.
- **Incubation Pitch**: Presented **WizFriends** to the SIT Torino team.

I have attached some pictures from my pitch presentation at SIT Torino, where I was able to showcase the vision for **WizFriends** and gather valuable feedback from professionals in the startup ecosystem.
